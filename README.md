# Advent of Code 2023

This year I decided to stick with what I know best - Javascript, specifically JS running in Node 18.

## Notebook setup

To simplify my debugging setup, and finally experiment with something I have been thinking about a bit, I set
out to set up Jupyter Notebooks (using the VSCode integration) to run Node.js code.

In order to do so, I installed the [IJavascript](https://github.com/n-riesco/ijavascript) kernel,
which allows Jupyter to run Javascript:

```shell
brew install jupyter
npm install -g ijavascript
ijsinstall
```
